This repository demonstrates a common error in F# when working with mutable variables. The `swap` function, while seemingly correct, fails to properly swap the values of x and y.  The issue lies in the way F# handles mutable variables within functions.  The solution shows the correct way to use mutable variables for a swap function, or to use more functional approaches without mutability.
